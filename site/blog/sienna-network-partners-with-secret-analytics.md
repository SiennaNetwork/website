To help users of [SiennaSwap](https://app.sienna.network/swap) get a quick overview, Sienna Network has entered a partnership with Secret Analytics, which is the leading analytics platform for [Secret Network.](https://scrt.network/)

Analytics is important to get an overview of the use of SiennaSwap and with this partnership we enable users to get insight into everything from the volume of each pair to fees and trends.

Data is fetched directly at blockchain level and does not come from Sienna Network. This means you will have insights from an independent third-party.
