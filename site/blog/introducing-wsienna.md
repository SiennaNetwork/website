There are some exciting news to share with the Sienna community ‚Äî introducing wrapped SIENNA (wSIENNA)!

‚Äç

#### **What is wSIENNA?**‚Äç

Wrapped SIENNA (wSIENNA) is an ERC-20 version of $SIENNA (Sienna Network‚Äôs governance token). It will be listed on a decentralized exchange on Ethereum and will be compatible with Secret Networks‚Äô Ethereum bridge.

‚Äç

#### **How does wSIENNA work?**

It‚Äôs a zero sum game. You lock up SIENNA on the bridge and it mints wSIENNA. If you want your SIENNA back ‚Äî you send it to the bridge, which then burns the wSIENNA and releases your SIENNA back to you. It‚Äôs that simple.

#### **Why would you use wSIENNA?**
