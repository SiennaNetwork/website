#### Secret Network SNIP tokens will become IBC-compatible

Thanks to [SCRT Labs](https://scrtlabs.com/), SNIP tokens (including SIENNA) will become IBC-compatible in the very near future. This will unlock a wide array of new possibilities for development and expanding partnerships within the broader IBC/Cosmos community (including potentially listing SIENNA on Osmosis, Astroport, TerraSwap, Mars Protocol, JunoSwap, etc.).
