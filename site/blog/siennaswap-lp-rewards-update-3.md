##### Reasoning

Liquid staking solutions—such as Shade Protocol’s stkd-SCRT — provide users with yield-earning opportunities that would otherwise be unavailable to them. When users LP SIENNA / stkd-SCRT, they are not only earning LP rewards in SIENNA, but are also accruing SCRT staking rewards on their stkd-SCRT. Therefore, boosting the LP rewards of the SIENNA / stkd-SCRT pool, while lowering the LP rewards of the SIENNA / sSCRT pool is in the best interest of SiennaSwap users (2 income streams with SIENNA / stkd-SCRT, as opposed to only 1 with SIENNA / sSCRT).
