As described in last week’s development report, the rewards code was submitted to Certik which in return said the pre-report will most likely be ready around Monday August 9th.

If the pre-report turns out fine then a launch date can be set.

Besides the eager wait for the pre-report here’s what else has been happening since last week:

*   More front end work on SiennaSwap 2.0
*   Design optimizations
*   Marketing preparation for launch 🚀
*   UI panel for private sale investors launching this coming week where they can claim their vested private sale tokens.

Stay tuned early next week! News about the pre-report will be shared with the community as soon it has been received. Until then — see you next week!
