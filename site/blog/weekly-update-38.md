#### **AMA with Secret Spaceman NFT**

**Host:** Let us begin this AMA by having you tell us a little bit about yourself. When did your crypto journey begin?

**_Secret Spaceman team:_** _Hey everyone. I am really happy to be here. I am a space systems engineer and an author with passion towards space science. As a team we are 6 people working on the project. My crypto journey began 1 year back._

**Host:** When did you first venture into the land of NFTs?

**_Secret Spaceman team:_** _I ventured into NFTs 3 months back. I bought my first NFT from secret network and fell in love with the privacy utility._

**Host:** What is Secret Spaceman?

**_Secret Spaceman team:_** _Secret spaceman is a collection of 100 NFTs. The collection has 10 categories, with each category having a spacesuit specifically designed for corresponding exoplanet/exo-moon surfaces. (One Spacesuit for 10 surfaces). The team has curated each spaceman and exoplanet surface with utmost imagination and love toward space science fiction while also trying to stay as close to science as possible._

_The community will be a place where you could talk, interact, learn and discuss ideas about space and our existence. Not just that, we have many exciting products lined up to enable you and even your family to engage yourselves in learning more about the space and beyond._

**Host:** Can you provide a brief breakdown of the different rarities?

**_Secret Spaceman team:_** _Each NFT is completely 3D rendered. Each and everything is unique! The exoplanet surface textures, alien worlds, dyson sphere all are embedded as art._

**Host:** Do the Secret Spaceman NFTs have a utility?

**_Secret Spaceman team:_** _Yes, absolutely._

_Goal — Immersive Space experience in virtual reality and metaverse._

_As a community — The holders/interactors get life-time access to space educational content._

**Host:** Will this be a game type of Metaverse or like a social club of sorts for holders of the Spaceman NFTs?

**_Secret Spaceman team:_**

_1\. Educational game-based metaverse with tokenomics - which we think will be one of the first with proper utility in the NFT space._

_2\. Access to exclusive space media content._

**Host:** How can Sienna utilize the Secret Spaceman community, and vice versa?

**_Secret Spaceman team:_** _First of all thank you for having me here for an AMA. Sienna community can follow us and support us which will be really wonderful. And from spaceman side, we can plan for WL to sienna community on the next phases and also share space knowledge and information. If anyone is interested do message us for guidance in space sector. (The first 100 does not have WLs)._

**Host:** Can you share any alpha about the collection with us today?

**_Secret Spaceman team:_**

#### **AMA with Secret Hunter NFT**

**Host:** Let us begin this AMA by having you tell us a little bit about yourself. When did your crypto journey begin?

**_Secret Hunters team:_** _My discovery of the crypto world is quite common. A friend recommended me to buy BTC when it was at $9k and fortunately I listened to him. Later I discovered NFTs thanks to OpenSea, but I consider that I am immersed in the crypto world when I met Secret Network a year ago. I carried my pockets of $SCRT and since then I am getting at least one NFT from each collection. I can feel that I could contribute something more to the community and I got to work on the project that is now known as Secret Hunters, and I have a feeling this has only just begun._

**Host:** Awesome, so is Secret Hunters your first venture into the NFT space as a creator?

**_Secret Hunters team:_** _Yes. The first NFT that I got was a SecretDog. I had a supply as I was able to do a quick profit since it was Tor Bair’s favorite dog, so I couldn’t enjoy it for long._

**Host:** What is Secret Hunters?

**_Secret Hunters team:_** _Secret Hunters is a 3333 supply collection in which the utility of private metadata will allow the community to fight to get the highest level creature by hunting each other. Fish, sharks, whales and krakens are going to invade the Cosmos ecosystem._

**Host:** What was the inspiration behind the Secret Hunters branding? The dynamics of the game where you have to hunt other NFTs?

**_Secret Hunters team:_** _Offer something new to the community, a real utility that allows an interaction and competitiveness between the minters. Not a simple PFP project._

**Host:** Will the rarities be pre-determined, or will they be dynamic based on your NFT’s performance in the game?

**_Secret Hunters team:  
_**_Fish lvl 1–9_

_Shark lvl 10–99_

_Whale lvl 100–999_

_Kraken lvl 1000–9999_

**Host:** What is the Secret Hunters P2E game exactly? And how can users level up their cards?

**_Secret Hunters team:_** _A fish can hunt another fish of same level or less owned by the same account. When that happens, the prey is burned and the new level of the predator is old\_level + prey\_level._

_Once a fish increases its level to 10 or above it evolves automatically to a shark, at level 100 shark evolve to whale, and above level 1000 whale evolve to kraken._

_For this is considered a deflationary project. In the moment hunting a card with a lower level. In the future also you can level up your cards with $FISH token._

**Host:** What utility will the $FISH token serve? How can users earn it? Or is it still in the early stages.

**_Secret Hunters team:_** _Is a deflationary reward token since when you get an achievement in the game, such as evolving to a kraken or collecting all 4 creatures with the same traits._

_It will allow you to receive passive income with staking and LP staking. Also you can Stake your NFT if it exceeds level 6000._

_It will give you an advantage in the GAME, you will be able to level up your card (1 $FISH = 1 LVL up)._

_You can sell your NFT in exchange for the token automatically (unwrap) if you don’t agree with your purchase._

_Also 20% of total supply will get airdropped to minters and early supporters of the project._

**Host:** When is the Secret Hunters NFT mint? And has a mint price been announced yet?

**_Secret Hunters team:_** _3rd April for WL and 4th public mint._

_There are different mint options:_

_1 mint — 24 sSCRT_

_3 mints — 64 sSCRT_

_5 mints — 99 sSCRT_

_10 mints — 159 sSCRT_

**Host:** How can Sienna utilize the Secret Hunters community, and vice versa?

**_Secret Hunters team:_** _Sienna can lean on our community as they are people who love all the innovative projects based on the Secret Network. On the other hand, I believe that we can take advantage of the community and influence of Sienna to be able to inform ourselves and correctly create our next DAO with the $FISH token, having the privacy that the community deserves._
