In this week’s development update the latest news around the upcoming launch is shared.

\- Final testnet version is done  
Unexpected behavior with errors while uploading the build to holodeck-2 has been bothering the team all week. Maintainers of holodeck-2 are looking into and should have a solution shortly

Preparing deployment on supernova (the IBC enabled testnet) as well, which requires upgrading different dependencies and changing a few APIs in the deployment library. ETA early next week

Once the builds successfully upload to testnet it can be tested with the front end for a day or two before setting an imminent launch date for mainnet! 🚀

As you can probably tell from the above it is getting closer than ever.  
Here’s other things that happened:

\- Added support for **SIENNA staking** which **will be live at the launch of SiennaSwap!**  
\- Front end development of SiennaSwap 2.0  
\- More work on Sienna Lend

Until next time! 🚀
