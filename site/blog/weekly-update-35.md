#### **Query Permits enabled on SiennaSwap**

Query Permits are a more user-friendly method to authenticate queries (in comparison to Viewing Keys). SiennaSwap users now have the option of enabling Query Permits. To do so, users can follow [this](https://medium.com/sienna-network/introducing-query-permits-160c30bd330d) guide (click on “this”).

#### **New IBC Integrations and SiennaSwap Listings**

Chihuahua Chain and JUNO Network are now available on SiennaSwap. Users can deposit native HUAHUA/JUNO using the SiennaSwap IBC bridge and wrap them into sHUAHUA/sJUNO using the SiennaSwap IBC wrapping tool. Users can also trade sHUAHUA/sJUNO on SiennaSwap-SIENNA<>sHUAHUA/sJUNO pools have been seeded with initial liquidity.

‍

#### **SiennaSwap LP Rewards Update**

A 10% point increase in LP rewards has been added to Rewards V3 (from Rewards V2). V3 now has 90% of the total LP rewards allocation, while V2 has 10% remaining. The final 10% of rewards from V2 will be migrated to V3 this week. In 1 week, V3 will have 100% of the LP rewards allocation, and V2 will be deprecated and no longer pay out any LP rewards.

‍

#### **What’s Next?**

As we approach the launch of new major product releases (such as SiennaLend, SiennaDAO, SiennaLaunch) our focus is shifting towards raising awareness for these developments. The Sienna community can expect a gradual increase in marketing efforts over the coming weeks.
