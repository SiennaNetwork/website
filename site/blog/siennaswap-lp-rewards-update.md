A 10% point increase in LP rewards has been added to Rewards V3 (from Rewards V2). V3 now has 90% of the total LP rewards allocation, while V2 has 10% remaining. The final 10% of rewards from V2 will be migrated to V3 next week. In 1 week, V3 will have 100% of the LP rewards allocation, and V2 will be deprecated and no longer pay out any LP rewards.

To migrate your liquidity from the old AMM V1 and Rewards V2 to the new AMM V2 and Rewards V3, please follow the steps outlined in [this](https://medium.com/sienna-network/siennaswap-amm-v2-rewards-v3-migration-6512ba01d578) blog post (click on “this”).
