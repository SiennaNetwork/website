A 10% point increase in LP rewards has been added to Rewards V3 (from Rewards V2). Rewards V3 now has 100% of the total LP rewards allocation, while V2 has 0% remaining. Rewards V2 is now deprecated and will no longer pay out any LP rewards. To continue earning rewards, you will need to migrate your LP tokens to Rewards V3.

To migrate your liquidity from the old AMM V1 and Rewards V2 to the new AMM V2 and Rewards V3, please follow the steps outlined in [this](https://medium.com/sienna-network/siennaswap-amm-v2-rewards-v3-migration-6512ba01d578) blog post.
