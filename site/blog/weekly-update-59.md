#### Things that happened last week

\- While testing the new governance/SiennaLaunch SIENNA staking pool, we discovered a few missing business logic features, which are now fixed and pending auditing. In the meantime, the new SIENNA staking pool will be deployed on mainnet for testing and preparation until audit is complete. This should not take long.

\- More SiennaLaunch testing.

\- Reviewing SiennaLaunch applications (more submissions received).

\- Coordination with some of the initial projects to list on SiennaLaunch is ongoing.

#### Shockwave Delta Scheduled for September 13

Shockwave Delta is the next major Secret Network upgrade. This upgrade will enable IBC-compatibility for SNIP-20 tokens (secret tokens, such as SIENNA). This will allow SIENNA to become transferrable across all IBC-enabled chains (will also make listings possible on IBC decentralized exchanges).
