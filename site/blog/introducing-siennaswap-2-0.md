#### Introducing SiennaSwap 2.0

[SiennaSwap](http://app.sienna.network/) has undergone a comprehensive transformation. SiennaSwap 2.0 features a refreshed UI, significant performance improvements, and new tools aimed at improving user experience and lowering the barriers to entry for new users. SiennaSwap 2.0 is where innovation meets elegance and simplicity.

‍

##### **New Landing Page and Dashboard**

The SiennaSwap 2.0 update features a new Sienna Network landing page that was carefully designed and crafted with user experience and ease of use as the main focus. The dashboard on the landing page contains thoughtfully organized information that is relevant to users, such as SIENNA price, staking APR, market cap, TVL, circulating supply, and a section featuring upcoming updates. Users also have the option to interact with the website using regular and dark modes. Users can easily navigate to the SiennaSwap app using the “Use SiennaSwap” button on the top of the dashboard.

‍

##### **New Swap Interface**

SiennaSwap 2.0 features a  new, easy to use Swap interface. Users can swap tokens by manually inputting the swap amount or by using the built-in percentage selection tool, which allows them to swap a set percentage of their selected token amount.

‍

##### **New Pools & Rewards Interface**

In addition to a new Swap interface, SiennaSwap 2.0 also features new Pools and Rewards interfaces. Users can create new pools by selecting 2 tokens and adding liquidity for both using a 1:1 ratio, or they can simply provide liquidity to one of the existing LP pools.

The new Rewards interface includes guides and tips aimed at helping users optimize their SIENNA earnings. Users can easily navigate between all the available rewards pairs and their own rewards pairs. In order to submit LP tokens to earn rewards, users can select the pairs for which they have provided liquidity, specify the percentage of their LP that they would like to lock up in the rewards contract, and begin earning immediately.

‍

##### **Wrap Tool**

SiennaSwap 2.0 features a built-in wrap tool that allows users to wrap their IBC tokens into secret tokens. To do this, users must first perform an IBC deposit directly on SiennaSwap. Once they have deposited their IBC tokens, they can then use the wrap tool to transform them into secret tokens, at which point they can use them to interact with the SiennaSwap app. Users can unwrap and withdraw their IBC tokens in a permission-less manner at any point.

#### **What’s Next?**

The rewards migration from V2 to V3 will occur next week. As we inch closer to the launch of new products such as SiennaLend, Sienna DAO and Sienna Launchpad, we will continue to work diligently on improving performance, user experience and ease of use. We believe that these aforementioned factors are paramount to overall user satisfaction and Sienna’s continued growth, and we will continue improving upon them.
