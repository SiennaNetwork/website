#### SiennaLend Launching April 29th

It was previously announced that SiennaLend will launch April 27th. However, there is a significant Secret Network upgrade ([Shockwave Alpha](https://twitter.com/SecretNetwork/status/1514297320304611332)) occurring on that day. In order to give all the nodes on the network time to complete the upgrade, **SiennaLend will launch on April 29th**.
