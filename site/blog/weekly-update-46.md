#### SiennaLend sUST/sLUNA Markets Postmortem

*   During the Terra-LUNA collapse, the Band Protocol oracles used for the sUST/sLUNA SiennaLend markets stopped suddenly.
*   SiennaLend faced rapidly increasing bad debt as a result of the Terra collapse.
*   The sUST/sLUNA bad debt was covered by Sienna Network core contributors.

_“With UST losing its peg and the LUNA price dipping to oblivion, the whole Cosmos DeFi ecosystem suffered from the ensuing snowball effect. SiennaLend faced issues with rapidly increasing bad debt, which we managed to limit so that exposed users do not suffer losses.”_
