This is probably the development update everyone has been waiting for.

**Wen** launch? 🚀 **Wen** lunch?

‍

SiennaSwap will launch October 7th 1pm UTC!! 🚀
===============================================

####   
What will happen in the days up until launch?

\- A final testnet version will be uploaded Monday

\- Preparing support for the IBC mainnet upgrade in October

\- Marketing push

\- Front end penetration testing

####   
Other things that happened this week:

\- More work on SiennaLend (everyone internally is hyped about the way it looks 🔥)
