SIENNA: [sienna.network/token](https://sienna.network/token/)  
wSIENNA: [sienna.network](https://sienna.network/)

#### TL;DR:

wSIENNA is a wrapped ERC20 version of the native token, SIENNA, which is the one launching on Uniswap.

SIENNA is the native token which is running on [Secret Network](https://scrt.network/).

_NOTE: You cannot buy the token anywhere before the Uniswap listing, so please be careful with scammers._
