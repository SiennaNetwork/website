#### **Rewards V3**

For some people rewards V2 have been acting erratically and is often hard to understand. Minor bugs in V3 have been ironed out and significant improvements are coming to V3.

Rewards V3 code will be public for anyone to inspect, undergo through testing and go through auditing before entering mainnet.

Some of the features in V3 include:

\- Auto claim on deposit/withdraw

\- Auto-restake on single-sided staking

\- Reset all user history on claim, no rolling averages, reward share calculated on the basis of your current participation only

\- Reduced complexity of calculations, enhanced procedures for validation of correct behavior
