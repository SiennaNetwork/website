#### SiennaSwap comparison with other DEXs

‍

![](/assets/external/615ab5b9adbad35715539025_1ft9_0exnor_rvz-me_sadq.jpeg)

_SiennaSwap has private swaps in the sense it’s front-running resistant and that you can’t query peoples’ transaction history from the pairs._

‍

‍

#### High yield + love for the Monero community

At launch there will be high yield for early birds so make sure you’re ready!

More info on eligible reward pairs coming shortly. All we can say is that Sienna loves Monero. There will be high yield for sXMR pairs on SiennaSwap!

All you need to do is to convert XMR into sXMR on the [**Secret Monero Bridge**](https://scrt.network/blog/secret-monero-bridge-is-live-on-mainnet)

Stay tuned for more information but here is a small teaser in the meantime(more eligible pairs might come) 👀
