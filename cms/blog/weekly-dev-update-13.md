The contributors have been struggling with deploying to testnet successfully via deployment scripts but with help from ChainOfSecrets, Enigma and a few node tweaks it should be resolved early in this coming week. Target is Monday.

This means it can be tested out with the front end for a few days and then a launch date can be set.

Other things that happened:  
\- More work on SiennaLend  
\- More work on SiennaSwap 2.0  
\- Fine tuning of SiennaSwap 1.0 front end  
\- Marketing team is preparing for launch  
\- Native [SIENNA is on CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sienna) and circulating supply / market cap data should arrive early next week

Updated towards the launch of SiennaSwap will be shared during the week as soon as there is something new to report üöÄ
