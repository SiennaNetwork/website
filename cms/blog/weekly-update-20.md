#### Back again with another update. Let’s dive right in.

Here’s what has happened this week:

\- Enjoy up to 10x lower fees on SiennaSwap (due to the [Supernova upgrade](https://scrt.network/blog/supernova-mainnet-upgrade-complete))

\- As mentioned in last week’s blog post rewards V3 are on its way. Once an initial version is ready it will be deployed on testnet for people to play around with — then undergo final changes and submitted to auditing.

\- More work on SiennaLend

\- More work on SiennaSwap 2.0 front end

\- More work on Rewards V3

\- More work on governance

\- More partnerships

\- Exchange listings coming this month

‍

That’s all for this week! See you next time 🚀
