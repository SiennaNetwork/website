#### It‚Äôs finally happening!

Sienna is happy to announce that the company is making a dual public sale on DAO Maker & Polkastarter! üéâ

  
In addition to the public sale, Sienna will also conduct an IDO (initial DEX offering) on Uniswap ‚Äî as well as listing on Sienna‚Äôs AMM, Sienna Swap.

  
The news follows the successful and 200% oversubscribed private token sale, Sienna has been swamped by the interest and demand for the Sienna Governance Token. A number of notable Tier 1 investors have participated in the private sale and are committed to build the community further.

  
The price per token for the private sale was $5. The price per token for the public sale is $6.

  
DAO Maker and Polkastarter will offer [wSIENNA](https://sienna.network/wsienna/), the wrapped ERC-20 version of SIENNA.

  
It‚Äôs easy to convert wSIENNA into its native SIENNA token using the bridge on Secret Network.

  
By offering a public sale across two major launchpads SIENNA will be broadly distributed in the community, which will help build further awareness and demand.
